## COMPENSATION

### Revenue Share Model

Stéphane will receive a percentage of net revenue generated from the Turkish restaurant market vertical.

**Revenue Share Rate: [___]%** of net platform revenue from Turkish restaurants

*Select one of the following based on negotiation:*

| Tier | Rate | Market Context |
|------|------|----------------|
| Conservative | 3-5% | Lower risk for platform, standard for market access partners |
| Standard | 5-10% | Typical for partners who provide ongoing value and introductions |
| Generous | 10-15% | For partners critical to market success with exclusive access |

> **Market Research Note:** Revenue share rates for market access partners typically range from 5-15% depending on the partner's ongoing involvement and exclusivity. Food delivery marketplace affiliate/referral rates are generally 5-10% for physical products. Given Stéphane's role is market introduction (not ongoing sales), **5-10% is the recommended range**.

**Revenue Calculation:**
- "Net Platform Revenue" = Transaction commissions (5%) + Service fees (2%) + Subscription fees
- Excludes: Refunds, chargebacks, payment processing fees
- Applies only to restaurants in the Turkish food vertical

**Duration Options:**
- [ ] **Time-limited:** Revenue share applies for 24 months from each restaurant's signup date
- [ ] **Lifetime:** Revenue share continues as long as referred restaurants remain active

> **Recommendation:** Time-limited (24 months) is more common and protects platform margins long-term while still rewarding the partner fairly.
